# It's Time To Go

_Never be late again._

🫡 **Archival Note**  
This project was my first foray into software development, started when I was 16 years old. While the code is not big and sophisticated, and there are no [automated tests](/TimeToGoTests) to speak of, the main benefit of this project was learning how to **design, build, and distribute a working iOS application**, as well as handling the process of **software review and refactoring**.
